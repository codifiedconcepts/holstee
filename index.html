Ask the next person you see what their <span goals="goals">passion</span> is, and share your <span class="goals">inspiring dream</span> with them. Travel often; getting lost will help you <span class="goals">find yourself</span>. Some opportunities only come once, <span class="goals">seize them</span>. Life is about the people you meet, and the things you create with them so go out and <span class="goals">start creating</span>. Life is short. Live your <span class="goals">dream</span> and share your passion.</p>
